# 首席伴娘的婚宴致辞 Maid of Honor Toast


得到我的首席伴娘的许可，把她在我婚宴上的致辞贴在这里。

大家好，我是（首席伴娘）。我在四年前认识的（新娘），那是她来这里的第二年。我对她的第一印象是新生见面会。那是卑微人生中记忆最深刻的一次自我介绍。我和（新娘）最经常做的事就是一起吃饭，我们几乎吃遍了（村里）的每一个餐厅，我们知道哪家餐厅的哪个菜最好吃。每次我们都提前约好然后激动地一起出门。和她一起吃饭的经历点亮了我在（村里）的时光。

For those of you who do not know me, my name is (the Maid of Honor). I knew (the Bride) from four years ago when I first came here. That was her second year in (our town). The first impression of her starts from the new students’ meeting. That is the most impressive introduction in my life. We almost went through every restaurant in (our town). Every day at 5pm, one of us must text each other, I am starving, where should we eat? Now I really miss her when I ordered her favorite dishes, three spices chicken.

然而我们不仅仅是普通的饭友，更是生活里的挚友。（新娘）是一个温暖善良的人，她会力所能及地帮助每一个需要帮助的人。在我状态不好的时候，她会时不时地发消息问我的近况。每次她见我都会给我一个大大的拥抱。（新娘）还是个很热爱生活的人，她对她自己热爱的东西有着执着的热情。她能沉浸在自己的世界里完全不受外界的打扰。 我一直特别希望能有个人陪伴她，一起生活在她的世界里，和她分享她的快乐，直到她遇见了（新郎）。我记得每次（新娘）提到（新郎）时脸上的微笑。

(The Bride) has always been a kind and warm girl. She would try her best to help anyone in need. Whenever I feel down, she would text me to ask me how I am doing. She gave me a huge hug whenever she saw me. She is a supporting friend all the time. She also has a passion for life. She has a determined love for the things that she enjoys. She can totally immerse in her world without being disturbed by others. I know her favorite things are watching comics and playing video games. I have always wished that there can be someone accompany her, live in her world with her and share her happiness with her, till she met (the Groom). I remember the smile and happiness on (the Bride)’s face when she talks about (the Groom). This cute couple they shared the same interests, and they know each other so well.

好的感情是有很多表现形式的，而我在（新娘）和（新郎）的感情里看到的是互相理解，互相信任和互相支持。他们好像找到了生活的平衡点，只要两个人在一起，无论做什么都是开心的。我相信他们这一份对生活共同的热情能够让他们安然地度过生活的起起伏伏。（新郎）给我的感觉是个温柔安静的男孩子，我很高兴能有人代替我在（新娘）身边陪伴她照顾她。每次我们出去吃饭，（新娘）总是期待着最后的甜点。我很高兴，她找到了她一生所爱的甜点。

现在，女士们先生们，请起立，与我一起，敬新娘和新郎。

希望你们的爱像风，强大到连云都可以吹散，温柔到永远不会令彼此受伤，而它永远不会结束。

Good relationships have a lot of different expressions, and what I see from (the Bride) and (the Groom) is mutual understanding, mutual trust and mutual support. They seem to have found the sweet spot in life where no matter what they do is fulfilling as long as they are together. I believe this shared passion for life of them will help them go through life’s thick and thin. I feel that (the Groom) is a warm, thoughtful gentleman. It’s great that there’s him in (the Bride)’s life to be with her and take care of her. Every time we go out for dinner, (the Bride) always expects the dessert all the way till the end. I am so glad she found her dessert for life.

Now ladies and gentlemen would you all please stand and join me in a toast to (the Bride) and (the Groom).

May your love be like the wind, strong enough to move the clouds, soft enough to never hurt, but always never ending.
