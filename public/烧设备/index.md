# 烧设备


起源于我需要一个耳机。选择恐惧症，所以让友人推荐，当机立断选了Sennheiser Momentum 2.0，下单，买了ivory色，税后$330.59，后来觉得白色不耐脏而且容易看腻，又换成了brown税后$355.85. 多了$25但是好看呀，我忍了。

顺便在跟有钱友人吃饭前跟她提了一下，说我买了个耳机。然后她说，我有一个哎，才$200在德国买的。后来我跟她确定，她的是Sennheiser Momentum 1.0已经买了几年了。因为我坚信“新的就是好的，贵有贵的道理”所以还是没动摇。友人出门前顺手把它带上了，一路上我就听，感觉不错，更坚定了我买这款的信心。

转折来了。友人说，Momentum is an affordable good headphone. 但它就只值200啊，I would spend $200 for momentum, but not $350. 因为2没有对1进行什么改进，it's the same anyway. The sound won't change.

然后友人就开始长篇大论了。



<blockquote>I would say the improvement is not significant if your music file is not loss-less file. I would say if you wanna spend $300, you should go with other brands and model, e.g. Denon.

Different headphones have different sound.

If you like to listen to jazz, buy Grado.

Heavy rock and beats, get Beats, Detox.

Sennheiser is for pop.

Denon is classic.

B&O (Bang and olufsen) is for classic and pop.

Denon and B&O would suit rock, but it depends too on the version of headphones.

Harman Kardon is good too.

For games, use audio technical.

Bose is kind of OK and cheap. Bose sound link mini is good.</blockquote>



（嗯，我知道我现在比较爱听的是pop, jazz, rock, not metal....）



<blockquote>Don't buy beats, over priced, and they only have bass.

High end for sennheiser cost from $300 to $5000. The code starts with HD.

If you are going to buy $300, get B&O H6. Also a German brand, considered the luxury audio brand, very very expensive and good.

If you want the best home audio system, go for meridian. $30,000.

Look at the ohm carefully. Some headphones need an amplifier.

Macintosh builds the best amp.

B&O focuses on speakers and stereo systems. But they make good headphones at that price. But if you are talking about $1500 headphones, they are not good. That's why they don't make the very high end.

If the ohm is around 5-20 you can use it. If it's too high you will need an amp. Because the amp can convert the sound frequency that you can't hear to the frequency that you can hear. But that only happens to loss-less music file. 1 min will be 10 MB. The jack should be gold plated too. For good headphones, for best sound quality, don't buy wireless. And the best music player that's not computer is iPod classic that is already gone. It lays music right from the hardware, not software like iPhone or iPod touch.</blockquote>



然后我才意识到，人家毕竟是有钱人，啥都玩过，懂行得很。她还只算是比较了解，用比较便宜的Sennheiser IE8 ($319)和$200的momentum，她说她弟弟是真发烧友，用的耳机都是$3000起，便宜的也是AKG N90Q这样$1500的款。

嗯，我知道我现在的预算是$400封顶。嗯，在最开始我只想$300封顶的。

嗯，我以前对耳机的认识也就只知道bose, beats, AKG, sennheiser, sony这几个牌子的名字而已，对于型号一无所知。

嗯，我现在对耳机的认识也就是多知道了几个牌子，知道了几个型号而已，但因为通通没有亲耳听过，没有do some research, 也只能算是个文盲（耳盲？）。

嗯，所以我在听了有钱友人的一席话之后，立刻拍板决定买B&O.

因为它长得好看。

我就是这么肤浅。（耸肩无辜脸）

（正确答案难道不应该是去do some research for headphones吗。）
